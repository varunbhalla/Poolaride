Pool A Ride is an android application for connecting people travelling similar routes
in an auto or taxi in order to cut their cost of tavel and also reduce the traffic on
roads. The app is still work in progress with most of the functionality complete.

The app integrates Facebook and uses the Parse.com cloud for data storage and push notifications.



To Run The App

-Clone the repository and open the Android project.
-Add your Parse application id and client key in the relevant areas( I've added comments in the classes)
-Add your Facebook application id in strings.xml
